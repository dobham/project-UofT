**The System**
Create a mini platform via the use of the profiles to be able to add other users, have friends added show on a list on the profile page, and be able to keep track of networks that you have met with

**A Solution**
A clear solution to the clunkiness of communicating, a friends list will be able to allow direct messaging right on the platform without the need of emails or commenting systems.


**Additional Context**
It will allow our platform to become more robust, user-friendly and allow for more communication to occur on projects between creators.
